Project Artemis is an Open Sourced client developer tool for single endpoint testing of GraphQL queries (w/wo Apollo Client). Query endpoint testing and cache management can be done in real time for instant engineering feedback without the need for backend resolvers.

Debug and test query mutations and calls using introspection

The web based extension is best used for React and Express products/applications in development mode, and is available at the chrome store.

## Install
### 1. Chrome store
- Go to [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/project-artemis/gpncgocimlpojfgbphndpjgkkhdjhnpb?authuser=0)
- Click Add to Chrome button

### 2. Working with actual code base
- Fork the repo to your repositories
- Clone the reposotory on to your local machine 
- build the project 
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
- Open chrome and direct to chrome://extensions/
- Enable developer mode 
- click LOAD UNPACKED and upload build folder 

## How to use
Open the application built with GraphQL on Chrome and open inspector window. Artemis will appear and will render once a GraphQL query is detected from the site. If a website or hosted site you are currently testing contains Apollo Client, you should be able to see its inMemory cache. Otherwise, it will display empty object.
